# PulseCode

## Overview
PulseCode is an ambitious project aimed at enhancing developer productivity and code quality through seamless integration of various tools directly within the Visual Studio Code environment. The project focuses on providing easy access to code analysis, linting, and project management tools through a unified interface. While the project is currently incomplete, the groundwork has been laid for integrating APIs, static code analysis tools like PMD, and automating setup processes for a smoother developer experience.

### Current Features
- **API Interaction**: Simplified interface for interacting with GitHub's API to fetch issues and commit messages of a repository. (See `api_interaction.py`)
- **PMD Integration**: XML configuration for integrating PMD static code analysis into Maven projects. (See `pmd_integration.xml` and `pom.xml`)
- **Environment Setup**: A shell script (`setup_pulsecode.sh`) to automate the environment setup, including the installation of Java JDK, Python, and other necessary tools for development.

## Project Status
This project is currently incomplete. The initial idea was to create a tool that could be easily integrated into the Visual Studio Code Marketplace, enhancing the developer experience by providing quick access to useful insights and utilities directly within the IDE.

### Future Goals
- Expand the API interaction module to support more services.
- Improve the integration process with Maven and other build tools.
- Develop a Visual Studio Code extension to seamlessly use these features within the IDE.

## Getting Started
